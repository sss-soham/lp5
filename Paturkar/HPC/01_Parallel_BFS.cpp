/*
 * Parallel Breadth First Search (BFS) Implementation using OpenMP
 * =============================================================
 *
 * Overview:
 * ---------
 * This program implements a parallel version of the Breadth-First Search algorithm
 * for traversing graphs. It demonstrates both basic graph operations and parallel
 * processing concepts using OpenMP.
 *
 * Key Technologies:
 * ----------------
 * 1. OpenMP (#pragma omp)
 *    - A parallel programming API for shared-memory multiprocessing
 *    - Used here for parallel task execution and thread management
 *    - Examples in other contexts: parallel for loops, matrix multiplication
 *    - Directives used:
 *      #pragma omp parallel      // Creates parallel region with multiple threads
 *      #pragma omp single nowait // Single thread executes, others don't wait
 *      #pragma omp task          // Creates new task for parallel execution
 *      #pragma omp parallel for  // Distributes loop iterations among threads
 *
 * 2. STL Containers
 *    - vector<>: Dynamic arrays for adjacency lists
 *    - queue<>: FIFO data structure for BFS traversal
 *
 * Data Structures:
 * ---------------
 * 1. Graph (struct)
 *    - Adjacency list representation using vector<vector<int>>
 *    - Allows O(1) access to vertices and O(degree) traversal of neighbors
 *
 * 2. BFS-specific structures:
 *    - visited[]: Boolean array tracking visited vertices
 *    - queue: Maintains vertices to be explored
 *
 * Complexity Analysis:
 * -------------------
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Sequential: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
 * - Parallel: O((V + E)/p) theoretical, where p = number of processors
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(V + E) for adjacency list
 * - O(V) for visited array and queue
 *
 * Parallel Performance Factors:
 * ---------------------------
 * 1. Critical Section Overhead
 * 2. Load Balancing
 * 3. Graph Structure/Density
 * 4. Memory Access Patterns
 * 5. Thread Synchronization Cost
 *
 * Q&A Section:
 * -----------
 * Q1: What is BFS and why use it?
 * A1: BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the current
 *     depth before moving to vertices at the next depth level. Used in shortest
 *     path finding, web crawling, and network analysis.
 *
 * Q2: Why use adjacency lists over matrices?
 * A2: Adjacency lists are more space-efficient for sparse graphs O(V+E) vs O(VÂ²),
 *     and provide faster iteration over neighbors.
 *
 * Q3: What does #pragma omp parallel for do?
 * A3: It distributes loop iterations across multiple threads, enabling parallel
 *     processing of independent operations.
 *
 * Q4: Why is the critical section necessary?
 * A4: To prevent race conditions when multiple threads try to update shared data
 *     (visited array and queue) simultaneously.
 *
 * Q5: What's the purpose of double-checking visited[v]?
 * A5: It's a performance optimization that reduces critical section contention
 *     by checking visited status before entering the critical section.
 *
 * Q6: How does parallel BFS differ from sequential BFS?
 * A6: Parallel BFS processes multiple neighbors concurrently, but requires
 *     synchronization for shared data access.
 *
 * Q7: What factors affect parallel performance?
 * A7: Graph structure, thread overhead, memory access patterns, load balancing,
 *     and critical section contention.
 *
 * Q8: Why use vector<bool> for visited array?
 * A8: It's space-efficient as it typically uses 1 bit per boolean instead of
 *     1 byte, though it may have performance tradeoffs.
 *
 * Q9: How does load balancing affect performance?
 * A9: Uneven distribution of edges among vertices can lead to some threads
 *     doing more work than others, reducing parallel efficiency.
 *
 * Q10: What's the impact of graph density on performance?
 * A10: Denser graphs have more edges to process but may suffer from increased
 *      critical section contention.
 *
 * Q11: How can we optimize the parallel implementation?
 * A11: Use larger grain sizes, minimize critical sections, employ better
 *      load balancing, and consider graph partitioning.
 *
 * Q12: What's the significance of the queue in BFS?
 * A12: The queue maintains the FIFO order necessary for level-by-level
 *      traversal characteristic of BFS.
 *
 * Q13: How does thread count affect performance?
 * A13: More threads can improve performance up to a point, after which
 *      overhead and contention may degrade performance.
 *
 * Q14: Why is the graph undirected?
 * A14: Each edge is bidirectional (u->v and v->u), suitable for applications
 *      like social networks or road systems.
 *
 * Q15: What are the memory access patterns in this implementation?
 * A15: Random access patterns when accessing adjacency lists and visited array,
 *      which can affect cache performance.
 *
 * Q16: What are the limitations of this implementation?
 * A16: - No handling of disconnected components
 *      - Potential overhead for small graphs
 *      - Memory contention in dense graphs
 *
 * Q17: What is the purpose of #pragma omp critical?
 * A17: Ensures mutual exclusion, allowing only one thread to execute a code block at a time,
 *      preventing race conditions in shared resource access.
 *
 * Q18: How does #pragma omp taskwait work in OpenMP?
 * A18: Forces the current thread to wait until all its child tasks complete,
 *      useful for synchronization points in the algorithm.
 *
 * Q19: What is the role of OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable?
 * A19: Sets the default number of threads for parallel regions in OpenMP programs,
 *      allowing runtime control of parallelism level.
 *
 * Q20: How does #pragma omp atomic differ from critical?
 * A20: Provides faster, hardware-supported atomic operations for simple updates to shared variables,
 *      more efficient than critical sections for single operations.
 *
 * Q21: What is the purpose of #pragma omp barrier?
 * A21: Creates a synchronization point where all threads in a parallel region must wait
 *      before any can proceed, ensuring coordinated execution.
